        <h2>Playful Dementia Care</h2>
        <p>Supporting people with dementia: Providing relief in care homes. Collaborative work.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p class="col-md-6">Our goal with this collaborative project was to support people with dementia and their
                family, friends and caregivers. Of course, we first had to do some research on the illness and the
                biggest challenges that come with it. We looked for information online in forums and different
                foundations. The Alzheimer Gesellschaft Ingolstadt helped us find people to interview about the illness.
                We also talked to a family member who takes care of her mother. Our interviewees asked us not to take
                pictures or publish any personal information.</p>

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>We came up with different concepts, but ultimately decided on a concept that would help modern care homes
                provide care for their residents and relief for their caregivers. Our app will work on big touchscreen
                TVs in common areas of care facilities and will offer single and multiplayer games. It can be used
                standing up or sitting down and will have some exergaming elements.</p>

        <section class="row gap-between-sections">
            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>Our personas reflect the aforementioned target groups: residents of care homes and their
                caregivers.
                Creating these personas helped us keep in mind their particular needs.</p>

            <h3>Paper Prototypes & Usability Tests</h3>
            <p class="col-md-6">Our paper prototypes were made on a tablet, but we printed them out and had a chance to
                show them to our
                interview partners. They gave us feedback on the games and game play. For example, we realised that we
                didn’t need buttons for rotation as pieces can be rotated on the touchscreen using two hands. This also
                adds an aspect of exergaming because these small movements can also be helpful.</p>

            <p class="col-md-6">After the final interviews and usability tests, we finalised our user journeys in Miro.
                The example shows
                the user journey for Math Genius.</p>

                Figma and we ended up with 51 screens.</p>

                    colourful and warm through the use of natural texture (wood, fabric). To make it more haptic, we
                    would
                    incorporate skeumorphism into the buttons.</p>

            <p>We used colourblind-friendly colours and based them on the IBM Design Library. Any other colour was
                selected to fit in and have enough contrast to work for as many as possible. The colour scheme was
                double-checked with the online tools Adobe Color and Coblis.</p>

            <p>We used assets from Freepik (see video credits) for our characters and backgrounds, frankensteining them
                together in a way that fit our ideas and story. My partner Roxana animated the final characters in Adobe
                Animate, while I composed some more assets and did some basic animations in Adobe After Effects. Using
                After Effects and Premiere Pro, I edited the video and added music by Roa (roa-music.com) and the
                voice-over generated with Eleven Labs.</p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>This was the biggest design project I’ve tackled so far. We only had a few months to complete the project
                from start to finish, which meant a lot of work and quick decisions. I am very proud of the result, and
                I have genuinely learned a lot. The project was completed in collaboration with Roxana Anchescu.</p>
