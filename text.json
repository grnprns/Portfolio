    "about_me": "As a designer focusing on UX, I help you guide your customers through your digital products, thus increasing satisfaction and conversion rates. I am pursuing a B.Sc. in UX design while working as a UX designer for my hometown, creating online forms people want to actually fill in while supporting other departments in processing citizen requests. Another degree in linguistics and foreign languages helps me communicate effectively in both the office and in my designs. In my free time, I love going on walks, honing my artistic skills in my sketchbook or teasing my brain with variant sudoku.",
