            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>The first step was analysing the old designs and, frankly, finding out what each option on the UI even
                did. It turns out, not every button actually did anything.<br>
                Talking to fellow students about the printer, common sentiments expressed were “What does this even
                do?”, “Nothing happens…” and “You can scroll?!” As a result, I went to try out every aspect of the
                printer with classmates, asking both them and myself about what we expect to happen. I took notes of all
                of my findings.<br>
                Below are excerpts from my analysis.

            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-md-6">The goal of these first sketches was to figure out the information architecture of
                    the new designs, ask questions and answer them.<br>
                    I focused mainly on the most cluttered screen (see above), figuring out if fitting everything
                    without sacrificing UX was possible or if options could be reduced or moved.

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>These wireframes were a continuation of the previous step, further refining the information architecture
                with basic design elements.<br>
                I kept focusing on the same screen because it was the most difficult to figure out. All the other
                screens were then modelled after that for consistency.

            <h3>Style & Moodboard</h3>
            <p>I decided to base my design and style on the CI of the university which uses these printers. The style I
                would ultimately use was based on flat design. Why? I wanted to create a modern, clean and
                distraction-free design, which is the exact opposite of the original design.<br>
                After deciding on a style, I researched which colours and fonts the university was using and made a
                moodboard to guide my design choices.

            <p>I made the following changes compared to the original designs:<br>
                Screens “Senden” (Send) and “Scanauflösung” (Scan Resolution) separated instead of pop-ups<br>
                Screens “Ziel” (Receiver) and “Basis” (Base settings) in two tabs<br>
                Filter options on screen “Status” hidden behind button “Filter”<br>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>This being my first major UI design project, I was understandably overwhelmed at first. Especially
                considering how packed the original design was.<br>
                In the end, however, I managed to make a design I am happy with while learning how to use Figma, which
                has now become one of my favourite tools to use.
